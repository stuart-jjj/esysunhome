# Holding-register dataKeys this integration actually writes via direct MQTT
# register writes (number.py's CONTROLS descriptors + select.py's mode
# register) -- NOT every can_set register the device model exposes. A live
# protocol dump showed the base poll segments are entirely function-code-4
# (input/read-only); the device's can_set holding registers span 13 separate
# segments, but the vast majority (500+) are internal/installer/factory-test
# registers (e.g. waveManualTriggerEnable, ipmosArrSet) this integration
# never touches. coordinator.py's poll-segment computation uses this list to
# add only the (usually 1-2) segments actually needed for write confirmation,
# instead of polling all 13 every 15s. Must be kept in sync by hand with
# number.py's CONTROLS list and select.py's systemRunMode usage -- there's no
# single source of truth linking them (importing number.py's list here would
# be circular, since number.py already imports from coordinator.py).
#
# This is matched against each register's own reported data_key (from the
# live per-model map), not the descriptor's nominal data_key -- so it should
# include every alias number.py's PowerControlDescriptor.aliases might
# resolve to as well, PROVIDED that alias is itself a genuinely writable
# HOLDING register (function code 3). "antiBackflowPercentage" is NOT: a
# live dump showed it living in the INPUT register list (function code 4)
# on this device -- input registers aren't writable through this
# integration's write path at all, so it can never resolve as an alias for
# Export Power Limit regardless of what's listed here. Don't add it back
# without first confirming (via a fresh protocol dump) which list it's in.
